Hey Renn!

Wahoo! I finished the last assignment! Honestly, this quarter of cs has been so much fun. I really enjoyed all the assignments and everything I have learned. This class wouldn't have been nearly as enjoyable without your help! The IGs were super helpful and sections basically answered all my questions. Good luck with all your projects and thanks for being such a great section leader!

Best,
Miggy
